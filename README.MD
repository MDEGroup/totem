<h1>TOTEM</h1>
TOTEM is a MDE tool able to extract a typing requirements model (TRM) from an ATL model-to-model transformation. A TRM describes the requirements that the transformation needs from the source and target meta-models in order to obtain a transformation with a syntactically correct typing. A TRM is made of three parts, two of them describing the requirements for the source and target meta-models, and the last expressing dependencies between both. We defined a notion of conformance of meta-model pairs with respect to TRMs. This way, the transformation can be used with any meta-model conforming to the TRM.
